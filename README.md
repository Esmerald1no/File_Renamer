# Tiff_File_Renamer

This code is part 1 of a 2 part project to aid laboratory research of spheroids.

Usefull for batch file renaming based on folder information.

After permissions are verified, future plans involve creation of an .exe file.

#FIXED : This code is untested as of creation of this README, so use it with caution. However, there are two known crahses: if you give it a name of a directory that does not exist,or if the program tries to access information on a subfolder that does not exist. These two have planned fixes.

It is also undocumented, but that is the next step.
